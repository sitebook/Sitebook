The <tt>Frequency</tt> and <tt>MinChars</tt> properties sets the delay and minimum number of characters typed, respectively, before requesting for sugggestions. An embedded <tt>TRepeater</tt> is used to Display the list of suggestions. It can be accessed and styled through the <tt>Suggestions</tt> property and its sub-properties.<p id="900022" class="block-content">

<p class="block-content">
On each request for suggestions, the <tt>OnSuggestion</tt> event will be raised. The event handler receives the entered token that can be used to build the list of suggestions and to dataBind() it to the <tt>Suggestions</tt> repeater.</p>

<p class="block-content">
When a suggestion is selected the <tt>OnSuggestionSelected</tt> event is raised, with the index of the selected suggestion contained in the parameter. Multiple selections can be performed in the same textbox. The selections must be separated by any characters specified with the <tt>Separator</tt> property.
